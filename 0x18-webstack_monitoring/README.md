# Webstack Monitoring using Datadog

This repository provides information and guidelines for monitoring a webstack using Datadog. Datadog is a popular monitoring and analytics platform that helps developers gain insights into the performance and health of their applications. With Datadog, you can collect, visualize, and alert on various metrics and events from your webstack, enabling you to identify and troubleshoot issues quickly.

## Getting Started

To get started with webstack monitoring using Datadog, you need to sign up for a Datadog account at [https://www.datadog.com/](https://www.datadog.com/). Once you have an account, you can access the Datadog dashboard and start setting up your monitoring environment.

## Installation

To install the Datadog agent, which is responsible for collecting metrics from your webstack, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Datadog account.
2. In the left sidebar, navigate to **Integrations** and select **Integrations**.
3. Search for the integration you need (e.g., NGINX, Apache, MySQL, etc.) and follow the installation instructions for that specific integration.
4. Install and configure the Datadog agent on your servers by following the instructions provided in the [Datadog documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/).

## Configuration

After installing the Datadog agent, you need to configure it to collect metrics from your webstack components. This typically involves modifying the agent's configuration file.

1. Locate the agent's configuration file. The location of the file depends on the operating system you are using.
2. Open the configuration file in a text editor.
3. Modify the configuration file to include the necessary settings for monitoring your webstack components. For example, you might need to specify the hostname, port, username, and password for a database integration.
4. Save the configuration file and restart the Datadog agent for the changes to take effect.

## Collecting Metrics

With the Datadog agent installed and configured, it will automatically start collecting metrics from your webstack components based on the integrations you have set up. Some common metrics that you can monitor include:

- CPU usage
- Memory usage
- Disk space
- Network traffic
- HTTP response times
- Error rates
- Database query performance

You can explore the available integrations and metrics in the Datadog dashboard. Additionally, you can customize the metrics collected by modifying the agent configuration or using the Datadog API.

## Setting up Alerts

Datadog allows you to set up alerts to proactively notify you when certain conditions are met. Alerts can be based on various metrics, such as CPU usage exceeding a threshold or an increase in error rates. To set up alerts:

1. In the Datadog dashboard, navigate to **Monitors** in the left sidebar.
2. Click on **New Monitor** and configure the conditions for your alert.
3. Specify the notification channels where you want to receive the alerts (e.g., email, Slack, PagerDuty).
4. Save the monitor to activate the alert.

You can also fine-tune your alerting by configuring additional options such as aggregation, timeframes, and suppression rules
